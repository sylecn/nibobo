** 2020-11-14 how to generate all solutions to show in GUI?
I need threads and blocking pipes.

In solver thread, push results in a multi-thread enabled queue/list.
In GUI thread, try read result from the queue/list.

- to make sure we don't use too much CPU, solver thread should create 10 results at a time, then
  block until GUI thread read existing results.

GUI design:

<puzzle board>           generate puzzle manully
                         next block
                         remove last block
                         finish placement

"click cell to highlight all block cells for next placed block. click the same cell to cancel highlight."
"click next block to confirm highlighted block."

game will recognize block type and varient, add it to game board and use correct color to draw it.


- button enable/disable logic. using FSM.
